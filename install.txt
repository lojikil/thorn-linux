Run the following on a fresh installation of Debian or BunsenLabs(https://www.bunsenlabs.org/installation.html).

If running on Debian, you may need to comment out the line in /etc/apt/sources.list that references the cdrom before apt-get will fetch online packages.

sudo apt-get install git ansible
git clone https://github.com/dovellr177/thorn-linux
cd thorn-linux
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts -e username=`logname` -c local thorn-linux.yml

NOTE: Some commands(like the one that updates the system packages) could take so long that they cause ansible to timeout, just run the ansible-playbook command again if there is an error after an especially long step.

UPDATING
========
from inside the thorn-linux directory, run the following
git pull
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts -e username=`logname` -c local thorn-linux.yml
