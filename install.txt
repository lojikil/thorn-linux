Run the following on a fresh installation of BunsenLabs.  During the Bunsenlabs installation, I would advise that you encrypt your system and split it among multiple partitions.

sudo apt-get install git ansible
git clone https://github.com/dovellr177/thorn-linux
cd thorn-linux
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts -e username=`logname`. -c local thorn-linux.yml

NOTE: Some commands(like the one that updates the system packages) could take so long that they cause ansible to timeout, just run the ansible-playbook command again if there is an error after an especially long step.

UPDATING
========
from inside the thorn-linux directory, run the following
git pull
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts -e username=`logname` -c local ./thorn-linux.yml
